===== তথ্যসমূহ: =====

যীশু হলেন ঈশ্বরের একমাত্র পুত্র৷ “যীশু” নামটির অর্থ হল “যীহোবা ঈশ্বর উদ্ধার করবেন৷” The term "Christ" is a title that means "anointed one" and is another word for the Messiah. The two names are often combined as "Jesus Christ" or "Christ Jesus."

  * The full name "Jesus Christ" emphasizes that God's Son is the Messiah who came to save people from being punished eternally for their sins.
  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to be born as a human being. His earthly parents were told by an angel to call him "Jesus" because he was destined to save people from their sins.
  * Jesus did many miracles that revealed that he is God and that he is the Christ, or Messiah.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Many languages spell Jesus and Christ in a way that keeps the sounds or spelling as close to the original as possible. For example, "Jesucristo," "Jezus Christus," "Yesus Kristus", and "Hesukristo" are some of the ways that these names are translated into different languages.
  * Some languages may prefer to use some form of the term "Messiah" throughout.
  * Other languages may prefer to use a word or phrase that means "anointed (one)."
  * Also consider how these names are spelled in a nearby local or national language.
