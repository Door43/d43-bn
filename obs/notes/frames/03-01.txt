বহু সময় পর, পৃথিবীতে বহু লোক বসবাস করতে লাগল৷ তারা ভীষণ দুষ্ট আর হিংস্রক হয়ে উঠেছিল৷এটা এতটাই খারাপ হয়ে উঠেছিল যে ঈশ্বর সম্পূর্ণ পৃথিবীকে একটি বিপুল বন্যার দ্বারা ধ্বংস করার নির্ণয় নিলেন৷

===== Translation Notes: =====

  *

**After a long time**  - This story happens many generations (hundreds of years) after creation.
  *

**very wicked and violent**  - It may be more natural to say, “had become wicked and did violent things”.
  *

**It became so bad**  – It may be clearer to say, “People were behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God.”
  *

**God decided to destroy**  - This does not mean that the earth would be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and the birds.
  *

**huge flood**  - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops of the highest mountains.
