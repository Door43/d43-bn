====== নতুন নিয়ম ======

===== সংজ্ঞা: =====

The term "new covenant" refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus.

  * The part of the Bible called the "New Testament" refers to this new covenant, which is contrasted to the "old" covenant that God had made with the Israelites during Old Testament times.
  * The New Covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus, which completely atoned for people's sins forever. The sacrifices made under the old covenant did not do this.
  * ঈশ্বর নতুন নিয়মটি বিশ্বাসীদের হৃদয়ে লিখেছেন৷ এর ফল স্বরূপে, খ্রিস্টানরা ঈশ্বরের আজ্ঞাকারী হতে চায়, আর তারা পবিত্র জীবন বাঁচতে আরম্ভ করে যা দেখায় যে ঈশ্বর তাদের জীবনে কাজ করে চলেছেন৷
  * নতুন নিয়মটি তখন সম্পূর্ণ হবে যখন ঈশ্বর তার রাজ্য পৃথিবীতে স্থাপন করবেন৷ Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will live with him in harmony.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "new covenant" could be translated as "new formal agreement" or or "new pact" or "new contract."
  * The word "new" in these expressions has the meaning of "fresh" or "new kind of" or "another."

===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  * **[[:bn:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a **New Covenant**, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the **New Covenant**, God would write his law on the people's hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the **New Covenant**.
  * **[[:bn:obs:notes:frames:21-14|[21-14]]]** Through the Messiah's death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the **New Covenant**.
  * **[[:bn:obs:notes:frames:38-05|[38-05]]]** Then Jesus took a cup and said, "Drink this. It is my blood of the **New Covenant**  that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it."
  * **[[:bn:obs:notes:frames:48-11|[48-11]]]** But God has now made a **New Covenant**  that is available to everyone. Because of this **New Covenant**, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.
