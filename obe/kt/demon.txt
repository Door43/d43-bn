অশুচি আত্মাকে   ======

===== সংজ্ঞা: =====

দুষ্ট আত্মারা হল সেই আত্মিক সত্তা যারা ঈশ্বরের ইচ্ছার বিরোধ করে৷

  * ঈশ্বর আত্মা সৃষ্টি করেছিলেন তার সেবার্থে৷ When the devil rebelled against God, some of the angels also rebelled and were thrown out of heaven. It is believed that demons and evil spirits are these "fallen angels."
  * Sometimes these demons are called "unclean spirits." The term "unclean" means "impure" or "evil" or "unholy."
  * Because demons serve the devil, they do evil things. Sometimes they live inside people and control them.
  * Demons are more powerful than humans, but not as powerful as God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "demon" could also be translated as "evil spirit."
  * The term "unclean spirit" could also be translated as "impure spirit" or "corrupt spirit" or "perverse spirit."
  * Make sure that the word or phrase used to translate this term is different from the term used to refer to the devil.
  * Also consider how the term "demon" is translated in a local or national language. (See: [[:bn:ta:translate:translateunknowns|How to Translate Unknowns]])
